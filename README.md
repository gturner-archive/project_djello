# Djello

A project from [Viking Code School](http://vikingcodeschool.com)

Djello is a task management app built to resemble Trello. It was built as a project to connect a Ruby on Rails back-end with an AngularJS front-end. The project features extensive front-end data modeling, API calls, and utilizes two-way data binding to limit page refreshes.

Users are currently able to create boards, lists, and tasks. Tasks can be completed, deleted, have members added to them, and all activity on a task is tracked. Go ahead and give it a try! A deployed application can be found [here](https://glacial-sea-80641.herokuapp.com).
